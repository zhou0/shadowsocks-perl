# Modify the config.json sample, save it to config.json. Run ssserver.pl on
# server, run ssclient.pl on localhost. Config your browser to use socks 5 proxy
# with remote DNS support and you can now break through the great firewall of

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shadowsocks protocol client.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Shadowsocks Official website |https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html>,L<Shadowsocks on Wikipedia |https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowsocks>


Net::Shadowsocks is a Perl implementation of the shadowsocks (Chinese: 影梭)
protocol client and server , Shadowsocks is a secure transport protocol based on
SOCKS Protocol Version 5 (RFC 1928 ).

1. A total of 34 encryption methods are supported:

        aes-128-cfb aes-128-ctr aes-128-gcm aes-128-ofb
	aes-192-cfb aes-192-ctr aes-192-gcm aes-192-ofb
	aes-256-cfb aes-256-ctr aes-256-gcm aes-256-ofb
	camellia-128-cfb camellia-128-ctr camellia-128-ofb
	camellia-192-cfb camellia-192-ctr camellia-192-ofb
	camellia-256-cfb camellia-256-ctr camellia-256-ofb
	chacha20-ietf chacha20-ietf-poly1305
	rc6-128-cfb rc6-128-ctr rc6-128-ofb
	rc6-192-cfb rc6-192-ctr rc6-192-ofb
	rc6-256-cfb rc6-256-ctr rc6-256-ofb
	spritz

2.The following ciphers deprecated by Shadowsocks are not supported:

        bf-cfb chacha20 salsa20 

3.The following ciphers recommended by Shadowsocks are not supported yet:

        xchacha20-ietf-poly1305

Please note TLS 1.2 has removed IDEA and DES cipher suites. and because of
CVE-2016-2183,  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2183
, this module has removed all support for DES and 3DES ciphers.
